# MJT Engine

A Culmination of years of development work.

Some of this is more utility-like. I often need a tool that does X so I'll create a tool that fits my mind well for that task.

Some more framework-like, where have stronger metaphore for a thing and want to continually use it.

Some of this is simply to hide what I consider the 'ugly' details of useful libraries, where I want to benefit from the library but I just can't buy into its way of thinking about the craft of software development.


## Goals

The goal of this package/project is to be a _single_ package that wraps up all my other projects into a neat bundle.

This means that it will be _too large_. Hopefully the 'compilers' will do their job of stripping out unused code to take care of runtime performance.


## License MIT
~~At the moment I'm still deciding on how this is to be licensed.~~

~~For now I'll say that you have my permission to use the library if you have access to it.~~

~~Perhaps I'll open-source this some day, but then again maybe I won't. It took me years of painful effort to create all of this. I'm not quite sure I'm ready to give it away without more careful thought.~~

It took years, but it is finally time to set this all free. This project is now MIT licensed. :)
